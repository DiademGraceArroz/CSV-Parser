# CSV-Parser

Convert a CSV File into a JSON file


A CSV to JSON parser is a tool that converts data from the Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). CSV is a simple and widely used format for storing tabular data, with each line representing a row and each value separated by a comma. JSON, on the other hand, is a lightweight data interchange format that organizes data in a hierarchical structure using key-value pairs. The CSV to JSON parser allows for easy transformation of data, enabling developers to leverage the flexibility and compatibility of JSON in their applications by converting CSV data into a JSON object or array. This conversion process facilitates seamless data manipulation, integration, and analysis in various programming languages and platforms.
